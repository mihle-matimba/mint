The current implementation is NOT matching the reference. Here is what’s wrong and what you must fix:

WHAT’S WRONG (CURRENT RESULT)

1. The chart sits on a visible light/white panel area that looks like a card background. In the reference design, the chart area does NOT have a separate panel behind it — it blends into the page background.
2. The background gradient is not continuous through the chart section. It looks like the screen transitions into a flat light block instead of a seamless gradient.
3. The chart does not feel “embedded” into the surface because the chart container has its own background/fill (even if subtle).
4. The purple lighting effect behind the chart (ambient glow) is missing or too weak. The reference has a soft purple bloom behind the chart peak area that blends into the same background gradient.
5. The line glow and shadow are not integrated with the surface — it should softly illuminate beneath it, not just sit on top of a light panel.

FIX REQUIREMENTS (MAKE IT MATCH THE REFERENCE)
A) Remove any card/panel background behind the chart completely:

* Set the chart container background to transparent.
* Remove any white/gray fill, blur panel, or separate “chart card” surface.
* No border, no shadow box, no distinct rectangle area for the chart.

B) Make the screen background ONE seamless gradient from top to bottom:

* Dark purple header area should gradually fade into a soft lavender/near-white base.
* The gradient must continue through the chart section with no hard cutoff.

C) Recreate the premium purple lighting:

* Add a soft radial purple glow centered behind the chart peak (mid-lower area).
* The glow must be subtle and blurred, like a light source inside the background.
* This glow must be part of the background layers (not a card).

D) Chart styling must match the reference:

* Smooth monotone/spline curve.
* Purple gradient stroke (electric violet → royal purple → lavender).
* Add a soft purple outer glow to the line.
* No axes, no grid, no chart frame. Only day labels.

E) The chart must feel integrated:

* The line should appear to “float” with a gentle shadow/blur.
* The surface under the line should look softly illuminated by the purple glow.

DELIVERABLE
Update the CSS and component structure so:

* There is NO separate chart card/panel background,
* The background gradient is seamless top-to-bottom,
* The chart and glow blend naturally into that background like the reference fintech UI.
