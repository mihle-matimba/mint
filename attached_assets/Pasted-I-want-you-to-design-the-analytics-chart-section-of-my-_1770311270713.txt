I want you to design the analytics chart section of my fintech dashboard so that it blends seamlessly into the app background instead of sitting inside a boxed card or container.

Chart container & layout:

1. Do NOT place the chart inside a rectangle card, panel, or bordered container.
2. There must be no visible border, no shadow box, and no separate background behind the chart.
3. The chart must appear embedded directly into the app surface.

Background integration:

4. The app uses a seamless purple gradient background.
5. The chart canvas must be fully transparent so the gradient shows through.
6. Do not apply any white, gray, or solid fill behind the chart.

Chart line styling:

7. The chart line must use a purple gradient stroke similar to a fintech dashboard.
8. Gradient colors should range between electric violet, royal purple, and soft lavender tones.
9. The line should have a smooth curved (spline/monotone) shape.
10. Apply a soft outer glow or blur to the line for depth.
11. The glow should match the purple theme — not gold or yellow.

Highlight & interaction:

12. Highlight the active data point with a circular marker.
13. The marker should use the same purple gradient glow.
14. Add a floating tooltip bubble above the point showing the value.
15. Tooltip styling should match the purple UI theme.

Minimal framing:

16. Do not include axis lines, borders, or grid lines.
17. Only display subtle day labels below the chart.
18. Labels should use muted gray or soft purple text.

Lighting & blending:

19. The chart must visually blend into the background gradient.
20. The glow from the line should softly illuminate the surface beneath it.
21. Avoid harsh contrast — keep the design atmospheric and premium.

Goal:

The final result should look like a modern fintech analytics chart that is embedded into a purple gradient dashboard background, using a glowing purple line instead of gold, with no boxed container or visible chart frame.
