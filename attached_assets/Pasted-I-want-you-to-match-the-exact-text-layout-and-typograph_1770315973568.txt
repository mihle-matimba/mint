I want you to match the exact text layout and typography hierarchy of this fintech investment dashboard screen. Focus on how the text is positioned and layered, not just the wording.

Top header text layout:

1. Place the greeting “Hello, Johnson” near the top-left, aligned horizontally with the avatar.
2. The greeting should use a slightly elegant/serif-feeling font style (or a refined font) and be medium sized.
3. Below the greeting, place the main balance “$24,897.43” on the left, larger and bolder than all other text.
4. Put a small “eye” visibility icon to the right of the balance, aligned on the same baseline.
5. Place the label “Account Value” directly under the balance in smaller muted text (secondary color), aligned left.

Tab row layout:

6. Below the account value area, place a row of three pill tabs: “Investment”, “Banking”, “Sales”.
7. Keep the tabs on a single horizontal line, centered/left-centered under the balance area.
8. The active tab (“Investment”) should be filled and visually heavier; inactive tabs should be outlined/subtle.

Section title + range toggle layout:

9. Below the tabs, place the section title “Invest” on the left in large text.
10. Place a small dropdown chevron immediately to the right of “Invest” (tight spacing).
11. On the right side of the same row, place the time toggles: “W” and “M”.
12. The “W” toggle should appear inside a circular chip; “M” should look faded/inactive.

Investment value block layout:

13. Under the “Invest” title, place “$4,449.30” on the left in bold, medium-large text.
14. Directly beneath it, place “(21% Previous Month)” in smaller muted text, aligned left.
15. Keep this value block clearly separated from the chart line so the chart does not overlap the text.

Chart label layering:

16. Place the tooltip label (e.g., “$8720”) above the peak point of the chart, centered horizontally above the highlighted dot.
17. The tooltip should be a small rounded pill and must sit on top of all chart elements (highest z-index).
18. The peak marker dot should sit directly below the tooltip and above the line.

X-axis label layout:

19. Place the day labels (Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu) below the chart line in one row.
20. Labels should be small, widely spaced, and low-contrast (muted).
21. Highlight the active day (“Tue”) with a soft rounded pill behind the text; other days remain plain text.

Primary CTA layout:

22. Below the axis labels, place a large rounded pill button centered: “View All Investment”.
23. The button text should be centered and medium weight.
24. The button background should be subtle with a soft shadow to feel slightly raised.

Bottom action labels layout:

25. At the bottom, place four actions in a row: Buy, Sell, Send, More.
26. Each action has an icon above and a label below, centered in its own column.
27. Keep labels small and clean with consistent spacing.

Overall spacing & hierarchy:

28. Use consistent left alignment for all left-side text blocks (greeting, balance, account label, invest title, value).
29. Maintain generous vertical spacing between sections so the layout feels airy and premium.
30. Use a clear hierarchy: Balance (largest) → Section title/value (medium) → Labels (small/muted).
31. Ensure text never looks cramped; keep comfortable padding from screen edges.

Goal:

The final layout must visually match the reference: stacked left-aligned text blocks at the top, tabs below, “Invest” header with right-aligned toggles, value block under it, chart centered with tooltip, subtle x-axis labels, and a large CTA followed by bottom action labels.
